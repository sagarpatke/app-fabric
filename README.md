# React Boilerplate
This project provides a boilerplate for ReactJS integrated with [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/).

## Build the project
Run ```npm install``` to build the project

## Start Development Mode
Development allows the user to keep a development server running, so that he can view the app being developed in the browser instantly. The app in the browser is updated when changes are made to jsx files. However, when changes are made to HTML files, it has to be refreshed manually.

After cloning the repository, run ```npm run build```

To start server in development mode, execute ```npm run serve``` in the project's home directory. The app can then be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
